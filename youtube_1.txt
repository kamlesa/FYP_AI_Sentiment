The biggest issue is not whether his answers are good or not, but that regardless of their quality, once the material you upload is desensitized, it becomes information that they are legally allowed to use however they please. This is especially true of the shameless Deepseek‚Äîhe‚Äôs Chinese, and I don‚Äôt want to defame him, but he stole my data. Even the API theft is just as blatant and shameless. I have reported it multiple times and even sent emails, but nothing works‚Äîthey completely ignore it! The data that I painstakingly accumulated over many years is now being used for training, and I am extremely angry!

I am Chinese. Our authorities believe that this policy is strategically aimed, particularly at addressing the unification policy of One China (Mainland üá®üá≥, Mongolia üá≤üá≥, Taiwan üáπüáº). From this, we hope it will proceed as intended to achieve the aspirations of the ROC nation and state. That's all.

You cant explain it for real ‚Äî> DeepSeek, the China-based AI startup that recently made headlines for its powerful and cost-efficient AI model, R1, has reportedly confiscated the passports of key employees to prevent potential leaks of sensitive information. According to AI reporter Kylie Robison from The Verge, citing a report from The Information, DeepSeek engineers are facing travel restrictions intended to safeguard confidential data, which may include trade or state secrets. The move comes amidst increasing concerns surrounding AI-related intellectual property protection, especially as global competition in artificial intelligence heats up.

Amit's statement that all A.I. model training necessarily requires NVIDIA chips is incorrect. Huawei's HiSilicon recently released its Ascend 910C chip considered competitive with NVIDIA's A100 and H100 processors.
Although DeepSeek R1 was reportedly trained on over two thousand H800 GPUs from NVIDIA, that doesn't mean DeepSeek will continue to use those H800s forever. FYI, the H800 is a "castrated version" chip, intentionally degraded by NVIDIA so that its reduced performance falls below the limit set by the Biden administration for US-made chips to be allowed for export to China.
No one had expected that the Chinese were savvy enough to harness these reduced powered H800 chips using smarter and more efficient software to power a LLM that is able to challenge world-class A.I. models like ChatGPT. 
Hats off to Liang Wenfeng and his team at DeepSeek!

Thank you Amit ji! I feel we don‚Äôt give enough credits to China and its efforts to produce quality products in all fields. I see that they can also produce great products making them more affordable and this tendency is reciprocated in India as well.

It would be interesting to see the actually see the model. Most of the appraisal of the system if vague om prc side or supposition on the part of experts. Nvidia is possibly just collateral damage as the US has just stepped in to  PRC the week before in Panama.

This analysis suffers from not enough research. Nvidia IS NOT the only GPU manufacturer. Chinaitself has more than a dozen GPU manufacturer, the most notable is Huawei. In fact, DeepSeek has declared that they are working with Huawei directly to optimize Huawei's GPUs for inferencing, and to a lesser extent, for training. DeepSeek's V3 has also been proven to run quite well on less expensive GPUs, such as Apple's MacOS computers. So, no, Nvidia IS NOT indispensable.

My admiration and wishes to you, Mr Amit, for making a concise and clear video. 
Please make a video on the US president's ambitious plan of 'Gaza Takeover' and resettling the people of gaza, the geopolitical implications, and India's likely stand on the same and likely outcome. Please discuss the role of the Middle Eastern countries or their reaction. Also a video on Trump's recent sanction of Iran and its effect on India - Chabahar port deal.

NVIDIA did a face-plant! Leave it to China to make everything cheaper! Sweat shops or not. But companies like NVIDIA are fueled by over inflated salaries which lead to face-plants.

Rather criticizing Chinese infiltration on AI space. We should appreciate their resilience of making something and ending the US monopoly on AI domain. Chinese can be called COPYCAT, but they are indeed doing everything as what can be repercussion if relying more on others than creating one for own.

Great Analysis Sir.

at 9:00, its about trust issue. who you prefer to collect ur data - US or China? so this is subjective. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been spied on for more than 10yrs by the US via iPhone. its also the same when u use our country's product. so if u r a normal citizen, ur worry should be ur phone number or email info being sold for marketing purposes (like receiving a call or email about a product being offer that you never subscribed nor asked to begin with)

The pain goes deep, 
1. Us AI companies have based their model  emphasizing the need for billions to develop. Now they will find it difficult to secure the next round of funding. 
2. Open Sourcing was a strategic decision many companies and countries will come up with their own LLM models, some may even collaborate with deep seek. Exclusivity gone
3. Keeping API and token price low  has brought in new customers who could not afford to pay high prices earlier now totally dependent on Deep seek . Us AI companies will now have to bring their API and token keys down to competitive levels to stay relevant. Revenue model gone
4. With loss of future private funding and sale decline  due to competition US AI based companies will totally now depend on US government aid
5. Nvidia is safe as of now only till Chinese learn how to make GPU it's not a matter of if but when

Problem is the world, more specifically the west knows that generally Indians are stupid and are only useful as 1st class labours, so much so that Altman visited India and told on our faces that India can't develop a comparable AI model. Yes you all read it right, he said exact same thing. And on other hand we got China, setting apart our differences, every time US tries intimidating them or  making them feel low, the Chinese come back 100x stronger.

Exactly. Good point. I was thinking the same. They probably built and finished it in October 2023. They were just trying it out before releasing it to the market. Also, they were waiting for open AI to release it  O3 version.

50k H100 chips is literally said by one dude who doesn't even know what he is talking about and he said it's assumption because he haven't even read the research papers yet. Since then many orgs and researchers replicated DeepSeek and proved the research paper was 100% true recognizing the innovation. 

All the smuggled H100s are claimed by the giants like Bytedance and Alibaba and DeepSeek is already using Huawei chips for their service and releasing reports about the performance compared to H100.

Irony is, Indians are end-consumers of such giant technological leaps for the mankind. Facilitated by cheap data and state of the art network infrastructure, Indians are the labrats in modern information age. Ambanis are running shipments of data for Western big data banks that are specialized in mining such data using AI cutting-edge tools to build products which influence consumer behaviour in India. ü§®üòï
